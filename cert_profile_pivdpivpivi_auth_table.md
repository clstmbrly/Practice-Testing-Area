permalink: profiles/allpivauth3/
---
**AS OF 12/20/2017 11:56 AM**

This profile specifies the unique settings required for X.509 **PIV Authentication** and **Derived PIV Authentication** certificates issued under the _Common Policy CP_,<sup>[1](#1)</sup> as well as **PIV-I Authentication** certificates issued under the _FBCA CP_.<sup>[2](#2)</sup> 

For standard, detailed certificate information, see the _ITU-T X.509 Recommendation_<sup>[3](#3)</sup> and RFC 5280<sup>[4](#4)</sup>.

## Treceability Matrix for PIV, Derived PIV, and PIV-I Authentication Certificate Profiles - Current Profile and Deprecated Versions

## Mandatory Extensions

* _These mandatory extensions are **common** to all PIV, Derived PIV, and PIV-I Authentication certificates._

| **Mandatory<br>Extension** |  **Critical** | **Value for All** |   |    |
| :-------- | :-----: | :----- |  :----- |  :----- | 
| Key Usage  | True |  digitalSignature. NonRepudiation is NOT allowed.  |  |    |
| Authority Information Access  |  | id-ad-caIssuers {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2} access method entry that contains HTTP URI for .p7c file containing certificates issued to Issuing CA.<br>id-ad-ocsp {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1} access method entry that contains HTTP URI for the Issuing CA OCSP Responder.<br>OCSP is required.  |   |    |
| Subject Key Identifier   |  | Octet string  |  |    |
| CRL Distribution Points   | |  This extension must appear in all certificates and include at least one HTTP URI to a file containing a DER-encoded CRL with a file type of _application/pkix-crl_.<br>This profile prohibits CRLs segmented by reason code; therefore, omit the reasons and cRLIssuer fields. |   |    |
| Authority Key Identifier   |  | Octet string (same as Subject Key Identifier in Issuing CA certificate). |   |    |
| **Mandatory<br>Extension**  | **Critical** | **PIV Value** | **Derived PIV Value**  |  **PIV-I Value** |
| Certificate Policies   |  | Applicable certificate policy:<br>id-fpki-common-authentication {2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.13}  |  Applicable certificate policy:<br>id-fpki-common-derived-pivAuth {2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.40} <br>id-fpki-common-derived-pivAuth-hardware {2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.41}  | Applicable certificate policy:<br>id-fpki-certpcy-pivi-hardware {2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.18}   |
| Subject Alternative Name   |  | Must include FASC-N name form and, after October 15, 2015, must also include a UUID.<br>The FASC-N specifies the FASC-N of the PIV card that contains the corresponding PIV Authentication key.<br>Any additional name types may be present.<br>Other names may be included to support local applications.  | Must include a UUID.<br>Any additional name types may be present.<br>Other names may be included to support local applications.  | Must include a UUID that contains the UUID from the CHUID of the PIV-I card encoded as a URI, as specified in RFC 4122,<sup>[8](#8)</sup> Section 3.<br>Any additional name types may be present.<br>Other names may be included to support local applications.  | 
| **PIV Interim**   |  | piv-interim indicator {2.16.840.1.101.3.6.9.1} is defined in FIPS 201-2, Appendix B.2, as PIV NACI indicator. The value of this extension is asserted as follows:<br>1. TRUE if, at the time of credential issuance:<br>(1) the FBI National Criminal History Fingerprint Check has been completed successfully, and<br>(2) an NACI has been initiated but has not been completed.<br>2. FALSE if, at the time of credential issuance, the subject’s NACI has been completed and successfully adjudicated. | Same value as for PIV.  |   | 

## Optional Extensions

_These **Optional** extensions apply to **all** PIV, Derived PIV, and PIV-I Authentication certificates._

| **Optional<br>Extension**  | **Critical** | **Value** |
| :-------- | :------ | :----- |
| **Extended Key Usage**   | True | If included to support specific applications, this extension should be non-critical. The following values for keyPurposeID should be included:<br>Microsoft Smart Card Logon; however, if the private key is not on a smart card, do not include the EKU for Microsoft Smart Card Logon.<br>TLS Client Authentication<br>pkinit-KPClientAuth<br>Additional key purposes may be specified:<br>TLS Client Authentication {3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2}<br>id-pkinit-KPClientAuth {3.6.1.5.2.3.4}<br>id-kp-secureShellClient {3.6.1.5.5.7.3.21}<br>The keyPurposeID value may be implemented as needed by the subscriber.  | 
| **Subject Directory Attributes** |    | This extension may be included to indicate the cardholder's country or countries of citizenship, as specified in RFC 5280.</sup><br>countryOfCitizenship {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.9.4}<br>ISO 3166<sup>[9](#9)</sup> specifies country codes. |
